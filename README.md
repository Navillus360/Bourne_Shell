This repo contains various ideas/projects that have been developed while learning Bourne Shell. Some are useful tools, whilst others are for fun (e.g., odd-even numbers, until loop, etc.)

*Note!* All scripts have been created and tested using Ubuntu's terminal and text editor, meaning that the functionality or compatibility with other programs, such as PowerShell, is unknown.
